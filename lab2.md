## Lab # 2

#### Why is it important to choose a license?
First and foremost, without a license, nobody will be able to contribute to your project, or redistribute it if they want to. This is a major reason to use open source projects, and without a license, you might as well be developing by yourself. Additionally, using certain libraries might require you to use a specific license in your project. In those cases, it's necessary to choose certain licenses. 

#### Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project without an explicit is a project that is NOT granting you freedoms. As a result, you aren't allowed to use it, modify it, or redistribute it. Essentially, if a project doesn't have a license, only the sole developer controls the project.

#### Do you agree with this claim?
I agree that Gopher's failure to  follow the open system model contribute to its downfall. It shot itself in the foot by not embracing the "hacker" mindset of open source projects. As a result, it simply couldn't gain the same following of users and developers that  is necessary to keep a project alive. This issue was compounded with forking, and Gopher ultimately crashed and burned.

#### Android uses apache 2.0:
Apache allows for total use for any purpose, is patent-freindly, as well as having better compatibility with GPL licensed software. (Which Android uses for its kernel!)

#### Better Licenses:
For a Developer, the LGPL is the better license, as it ensures that any project that uses a library made in LGPL, wouldnt have to be LGPL, but otherwise, others would have to contribute changes to the project. For a Company, the Apache License would be best, as it contains a patent license, which companies would often take advantage of. For the common good, the GPL would be the best license. The GPL would require all changes that are made to be contributed, and as a result, it would ensure more people could take advantage of the contributions of everyone.

#### Example project:
The project I'm considering to develop for this class is a life tracker/planner. I'm mostly making this as it's something I would like to have in my life. The users of this app would most likely be anyone else that has a hectic life or wants to track their progress in various activities. I'm choosing the MIT License for its simplicity and permissibility.
